/**
 * String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.
 * Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely.
 * An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the push() function.
 * .pop() is used to "pop" a value off of the end of an array.
 * .shift() is used to remove a value from the start of the array
 * .unshift('Something') puts something to the start of the array
 * to delete something from object use -> delete myDog.tails;
